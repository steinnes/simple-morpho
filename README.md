simple-morpho
-------------

This is a compiler I wrote for a simplified version of [morpho](http://morpho.cs.hi.is/).

I had a lot of help from professor Snorri Agnarsson and Hallgr√≠mur H.
Gunnarsson.

Putting this here because I love browsing my code via the GitHub
interface, oh and the commit messages are hilarious.
